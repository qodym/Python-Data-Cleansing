# Python-Data-Cleansing
Perform data cleansing from raw csv format datasets into csv format datasets that are ready for further analysis. This data cleansing process uses Python language.

## Data Exploration
Data exploration by analyzing the shape and value of each column of the dataset.
ensure that the data is not duplicated, has no missing values and the data type matches the value of the dataset column.

## Data Cleansing
Changing the datatype into the expected format from each table, overcoming duplicated data and deleting or filling in empty data / missing values (this consideration is based on data needs for analysis).

## Export Dataset
Finally we can export our cleaned data to new csv file, and can be download for next process.
